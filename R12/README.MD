# R13 Malware

## Overview
R13 Malware is a Python script that simulates basic malware functionalities for Windows operating systems. This script employs various techniques to demonstrate the capabilities of malicious software, including infecting the Windows registry, establishing a reverse shell to a malicious server, copying data from C and D drives to a remote server, encrypting files, and automatically updating the malware from a remote server.

## Features
- **Windows Registry Infection**: The script can automatically add itself to the Windows registry to run on system startup.
- **Reverse Shell**: It can establish a connection to a malicious server and enable remote command-line access on the infected machine.
- **Disk Copying**: It can copy contents from C and D drives to a remote server using the rsync command.
- **File Encryption**: Enables file encryption using XOR and AES ciphers.
- **Automatic Malware Update**: Automatically downloads a new version of the malware from a remote server and updates itself.
